Analysis for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells

We're primarily interested in what's happening with the T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in cluster 17 since this is our collaborator's main focus given their specialized role in helping B cells in affinity maturation. 
 
The big idea is to use the dataset to better understand how the phenotypes of Tfh change with time after vaccination, and also between blood and lymph node, using the TCR clonotype as a "barcode". 
 
How do the Tfh cells of the same clone changing over time with regard to their phenotype and numbers? Can we detect known Tfh clones from the LN in the blood, does this have some sort of pattern with maybe a 1 cell in the blood early on turns into many in the LN, or the other way, where we have expanded clones in the LN become detectable in blood later, and is there an alteration in these cases? 

Big questions are:
1) what are the longtiduinal dynamics of Tfh?
2) What the compartmental features (maybe GEX features by compartment)?
3) What's the interaction between these two (space and time)?
4) Is there evidence for "recall" vs. "naive" resposnes--I think they have some pre-vaccination time points? If so what are the differences in magntidue, kinetics, and GEX?
